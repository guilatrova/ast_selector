## Installation and usage

### Installation

```
pip install ast-selector
```

### Usage

```py
from ast_selector import AstSelector

tree = load_python_code_as_ast_tree()
query = "FunctionDef Raise $FunctionDef"
# Query all functions that raises at least an exception

functions_raising_exceptions = AstSelector(query, tree).all()
```

## Examples

### Query by AST type

Simply use the AST type. Note it should have the proper casing.

```py
AstSelector("FunctionDef", tree).all() # Any Ast.FunctionDef
AstSelector("Raise", tree).all() # Any ast.Raise
AstSelector("Expr", tree).all() # Any ast.Expr
```

### Filter AST by property type

You can filter property types by writing like: `[Prop is Type]`.

Condition: Any `ast.Expr` that contains `.value` prop and that prop is an instance of `ast.Call`

Result: List of `ast.Expr` that fulfills the condition.

```py
AstSelector("Expr[value is Call]", tree).all()
```

### Drill to AST property

You can navigate as you filter the elements you want by using `.prop`.

Condition: Any `ast.Expr` that contains `.value` prop and that prop is an instance of `ast.Call`, take `.value`.

Result: List of `ast.Call` that fulfills the condition.

```py
AstSelector("Expr[value is Call].value", tree).all()
```

### Filter AST by property value

You can filter property values by writing like: `[Prop = Value]`.

Condition: Any `ast.FunctionDef`, take `returns` as long as it contains `id` equals to `int`.

Result: List of `ast.Name` that fulfills the condition.

```py
AstSelector("FunctionDef.returns[id=int]", tree).all()
```

### Filter AST by multiple conditions

You can keep appending `[Cond1][Cond2][Cond3]` as you wish:

Condition: Any `ast.Raise` that has `exc` of type `ast.Call` **AND** that has `cause` as `None`.

Result: List of `ast.Raise` that fulfills the condition.

```py
AstSelector("Raise[exc is Call][cause is None]", tree).all()
```

### Drill down but take previous reference

You can keep drilling down, but take a previous value as your result by using `$[Placeholder]` syntax:

Condition: Any `ast.FunctionDef`, take `returns` as long as it has `id` equals to `int`, then take the original `FunctionDef`.

Result: List of `ast.FunctionDef` that fulfills the condition.

```py
AstSelector("FunctionDef.returns[id=int] $FunctionDef", tree).all()
```

### Filter and drill through references

You can keep filtering and drilling references as you would normally.

Drill `$Expr` and take `args` as result:

```py
AstSelector("Expr[value is Call].value[func is Attribute].func[attr = exception] $Expr.value.args", tree).all()
```

Drill `$FunctionDef` (redundant) and filter functions named `main_int` as result:

```py
AstSelector("FunctionDef.returns[id=int] $FunctionDef[name=main_int]", tree).all()
```

### Count functions

```py
AstSelector(query, tree).count()
```

### Take first node only

```py
AstSelector(query, tree).first()  # Raises exception if None
```

### Check if node exists

```py
AstSelector(query, tree).exists()
```

## Credits

It's extremely hard to keep hacking on open source like that while keeping a full-time job. I thank God from the bottom of my heart for both the inspiration and the energy.
